2. My code and the MG1 break-down activity are connected because the Player class has the attributes of the number of seeds, and the actions of the WASD movement from the if statements of Input.GetKey, as well as Input.GetKeyDown to control spawning seeds when pressing space. The player and seeds have sprite attributes as well. The MG1 break-down activity also connnects to the code I wrote in the PlantCountUI class because the UI has the actions of updating the number of seeds planted and remaining through the UpdateSeeds method. The UI also has attributes of the seeds planted and remaining text. As for the GameObjects in the game world, it connects to the MG1 break-down activity because the player, seeds, and the UI are GameObjects. In the MG1 break-down activity also, the player can spawn seeds and connects to my code because of the Instantiate method in the PlantSeed method.
